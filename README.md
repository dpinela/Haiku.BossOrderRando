This is a mod for Haiku, the Robot that randomizes the order of the Trial of Steel,
the game's boss rush mode. All modes - Mini-Bosses, Creators, and Boss Rush (all bosses)
are supported.

To use the mod, install it, then turn on "Randomize Boss Rush Order" in your mod settings.
By default, each time you enter the Trial, a new seed will be generated. To fix a specific
seed, input it into the Seed field in the settings.
